# Space Tourism App

This project was a real challenge for me.
I am new to React, but in this challenge i wanted to test out the react router.
It really simplifies jumping from one page to another without rendering new html page.

## Animations

Tried animations library called "framer-motion".
Also easy to work with, and it's nice when u can easily animate mounting and unmounting components with <AnimatePresence>

I learned a lot working on this project, helped me to grasp some of the core react principles.
Looking forward to learn more about react
